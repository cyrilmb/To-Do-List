# SQL To Do List

## Description

Our weekend challenge was to create a full stack application using SQL and node.js that will maintain a users to-do list. The user can add a new task and when it is due. This will generate on their incomplete list in red. When the user marks a task complete, it will render on the complete list in green. A user can edit or delete a task at any time.
